In the future this will be where the xSDK policies are kept.

# xSDK Community Package Policies

The IDEAS Project xSDK Team

Version 0.4.0, July 27, 2018

[https://xsdk.info/policies](https://xsdk.info/policies)

## Background

A key aspect of work in the [IDEAS Scientific Software Productivity Project][1] is developing an Extreme-scale
Scientific Software Development Kit ([xSDK][2]) â€” a collection of related and complementary software elements
that provide the building blocks, tools, models, processes, and related artifacts for rapid and efficient
development of high-quality applications. As an initial step in creating the xSDK, we have written the
following draft xSDK package community policies to help address challenges in interoperability and
sustainability of software developed by diverse groups at different institutions.

## Goal

Develop a set of **xSDK community policies** that a software library/framework (henceforth
referred to as package)<sup>1</sup> must satisfy in order to to be **xSDK compatible** . The designation of a
package being xSDK compatible informs potential users that the package can be easily used with
other xSDK libraries and components and thus helps to address issues in long-term sustainability<sup>2</sup>
and interoperability among packages.

We consider two categories of xSDK packages: **xSDK compatible** packages and **xSDK member**
packages. We also consider two levels of xSDK compatibility: **mandatory policies** and
**recommended policies**.

+ A package will be declared **xSDK compatible** once the xSDK team has determined that the
**package satisfies the mandatory xSDK policies** listed below. In addition to the required
policies, we specify **recommended xSDK policies** that further help to address issues in
software interoperability.

+ Similarly, a package can become an **xSDK member package** if (1) it is an xSDK-compatible
package, *and* (2) it uses or can be used by another package in the xSDK, and the connecting
interface is regularly tested for regressions.

Initially the requirements and process are informally presented; over time, if needed, we can begin to
formalize them. Currently the xSDK includes seven popular numerical libraries ([hypre][3] , [MAGMA][4] ,
[MFEM][5] , [PETSc/TAO][6] , [SUNDIALS][7] , [SuperLU][8] , and [Trilinos][9]) and two application
packages ([Alquimia][10] and [PFLOTRAN][11]), which satisfy the required policies. Over the longer term,
the xSDK may expand to incorporate additional packages, depending on community needs and contributions.

-----

<sup>1</sup> For the purpose of this document, the term *package* refers to a collection of source code
(possibly containing C, Fortran, or C++) that can generate zero or more shared or static libraries, zero
or more include files, zero or more Fortran modules, and possibly other auxiliary artifacts, including
executables, and whose functionality can be used by other packages and by application codes. A software
artifact that generates only an executable is, by this definition, not an xSDK package; that is, xSDK 
packages are libraries, frameworks, and domain components.
