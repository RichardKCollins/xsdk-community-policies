**R7.** It is recommended that each package should have a README or README.md, a SUPPORT or SUPPORT.md, a LICENSE or LICENSE.md, and a CHANGELOG or CHANGLOG.md file in its top directory.
The README file should contain at least the following information:

- a **brief** description of the package

- information on how to install the package

- a link to the package webpage (if there is one)

The LICENSE file should contain the full text of the license. If the full text can be found in a different directory or via a link to a website it is sufficient to provide a link to the full text in the file.

The SUPPORT file should contain the contact information that is required by community policy **M5** to be able to get help.

The CHANGELOG file should contain important changes or a link to a file or webpage with this information, but not each individual commit.

If providing additional information, e.g. on how to contribute, authorship, code of conduct, etc, it is recommended to consider suggestions in https://github.com/kmindi/special-files-in-repository-root/blob/master/README.md
