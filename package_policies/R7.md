**R7.** It is recommended that each package should have a README and a LICENSE file in its top directory.
The README file should contain the following information:

- a link to the package webpage

- contact information, i.e. how to get help (**M5**)

- a **brief** description of the package

- license information.

The LICENSE file should contain the full text of the license. If the full text can be found via a link to a website it is sufficient to provide this link in the README file.
