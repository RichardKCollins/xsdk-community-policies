**M1.** Each xSDK-compatible package must support either the **community GNU Autoconf or CMake
options**<sup>3</sup> as defined in the following document:

[xSDK Community Installation Policies: GNU Autoconf and CMake Options](./community-installation-policies.md).

The goal of this policy is to enable individual users, computing centers, and package managers (such
as [Spack](https://spack.io/)) to install the package in a way that is compatible with
other xSDK packages on the same system. It is understood that managing all the dependencies for a variety
of packages is nontrivial and is not resolved by standard options.

Python packages must contain a setup.py file in the top directory.

-----

<sup>3</sup> Note that the package is free to use any mechanism, for example Python as PETSc does, to implement
the options but to users they should appear as if a CMake or GNU Autoconf configure package.
