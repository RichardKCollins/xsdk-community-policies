**M1.** Each xSDK-compatible package must support portable installation through Spack.

All configuration, build, and installation phases must be specified in a [Spack](https://spack.io/))
package recipe.

The goal of this policy is to enable individual users and computing centers to install the package in a
way that is compatible with other xSDK packages on the same system.
