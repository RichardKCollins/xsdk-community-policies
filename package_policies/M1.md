**M1.** Each xSDK-compatible package must support portable installation through Spack.

All configuration, build, and installation phases must be specified in a [Spack](https://spack.io/)
package recipe.

Packages should have a build system that is appropriate for the language (e.g.~ CMake, Autoconf, setup.py), and the packages should attempt to follow the best practices and guidelines of the respective environment. For example, a proper configuration phase should be used where relevant (a list of platform specific makefiles would not be acceptable).

Packages must not override Spack's resolved dependencies (as determined by 'spack spec')

The goal of this policy is to enable easy and customizable installation of the package in a way that is compatible with other xSDK packages on the same system.
