**R6.** Each package should provide pre-processor macros for version
comparison (for languages that support it - like c/c++/fortran).
Using these macros, dependent software can potentially be compatible
with multiple versions of the package.

For example - PACKAGE_VERSION_EQ(), PACKAGE_VERSION_LT(),
PACKAGE_VERSION_LE(), PACKAGE_VERSION_GT(), PACKAGE_VERSION_GE()
