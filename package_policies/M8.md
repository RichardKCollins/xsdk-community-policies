**M8.** Each package must provide **a runtime API**, for example a function call, to return the **current
version number** of the software and indicate what configure/CMAKE and compiler options were used
to build the package. For development versions of the software, each package must provide the
current commit ID in the repository. With this information users should be able to rebuild the package
in the same state. We do not currently require that version information for all dependent packages be
provided, so it may not be possible to rebuild the entire software stack in the same state.

<sup>8</sup> For example, some projects import source for some routines from BLAS and LAPACK. The Trilinos Teuchos
package imported an early version of the boost::any class. Also, Trilinos has its own copy of an older version of
SparseSuite. In the latter two cases, new file names and namespaces were created for the imported software to
allow coexistence with the (updated) external versions.
