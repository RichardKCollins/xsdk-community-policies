**M16** All xSDK-compatible packages must be buildable such that they are able to receive array indices passed as 32-bit integers.

The API may specify a higher precision type, where upcasting is automatic. Packages that support an index size that is configurable at compile time, must expose this at the configuration stage. In Spack, this must be represented by a Spack variant following the [xSDK Spack variant guidelines](../installation_policies/xSDK_spack_variant_guidelines.md).

The configuration option is not required if all supported index sizes are handled automatically.

The aim of this policy is to prevent incompatibilities due to index sizing.
