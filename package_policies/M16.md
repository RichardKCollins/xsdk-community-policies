**M16** Any xSDK-compatible package that compiles code should have a configuration option to build in **Debug** mode. Debug mode must produce debugging symbols in compiled code and may contain further useful debugging information and additional error checking. Optimization should be disabled in the debug build.

In Spack, the debug build type should be enabled via the variants recommended in the [xSDK Spack variant guidelines](../installation_policies/xSDK_spack_variant_guidelines.md).

The aim of this policy is to enable the end-user to produce a version of the code that is suitable for debugging.
