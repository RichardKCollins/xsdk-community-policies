**M5.** Each package team must provide a documented, reliable way to **contact the development
team**; the mode of contact may be by email or a website. The package teams should **not** require
users to join a generic mailing list (and hence receive irrelevant email) in order to report bugs or
request assistance. The IDEAS project will not â€‹ provide a go-between for users of xSDK packages and
xSDK member packages. The xSDK strategy is to make sure that the xSDK functionality fits naturally
into existing library support models.
