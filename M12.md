**M12.** If a package imports software that is externally developed and maintained,<sup>8</sup> then it must allow
installing, building, and linking against an outside copy of that software. Acceptable ways to
accomplish this include (1) forsaking the internal copied version and using an externally provided
implementation or (2) changing the file names and namespaces of all global symbols to allow the
internal copy and the external copy to coexist in the same downstream libraries and programs.
